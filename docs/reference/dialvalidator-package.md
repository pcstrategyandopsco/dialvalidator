# dialvalidator: Phone Number Validation Using Google's 'libphonenumber' Metadata

Parses, validates, formats, and classifies phone numbers using Google's
'libphonenumber' metadata. Covers 240+ territories with support for
mobile, landline, toll-free, and other number types. Unlike 'dialr',
this package requires no Java runtime — metadata is pre-parsed from the
upstream 'PhoneNumberMetadata.xml' and shipped as a bundled R object.
Functions accept character vectors and return simple R types (logical,
character, data.frame).
